# SchoolProjects
Here are some examples of projects I have done in School.

Project 1 is a Roman Numeral calculator that can convert regular numerals to roman numerals and can also add two together.

Project 2 is a Movie Theater ticket selling program where the user can set up the number of rows and columns in a theater and set a price for each row.
Users then have the option to sell a ticket and print off the remaining seating chart.
